    <h1>Dynamic Programming Patterns</h1>
    <!---<p class="date">Feb 2, 2023</p>-->
    <p>
        Dynamic programming is optimized recursion. Instead of compute all possible states, DP use cache to reduce computation cost. The most difficult things about construction a DP solution is to decide the state transition which can have 2 directions (top-down or bottom up) and 2 dimensions (linear or matrix).
    </p>
  
<h2>Fibonacci Numbers</h2>
<p>In these problems, the state transition is in 1 dimension. The state at one index can be compute using 1 or more other indices until the end state is reached. The result of indices often cache to improve performance.</p>

<h2>0/1 Knapsack</h2>
<p>
    These problems involves making choices to arrive at a certain states, . The states and choices becomes the row and column of a matrix, the direction of state transition is in 2 dimensions, the state of one grid element depends on 1 or more other grid elements. 0/1 mean the choice can be 0 or 1 (not include or include).
</p>

<h2>Unbounded Knapsack</h2>
<p>
    Similar to 0/1 Knapsack problems, the state transition also in 2 dimensions. However the choice can be made unlimited number of time, hence the name unbounded. The state, however, need to be bounded.
</p>

<h2>Longest Common Subsequence</h2>
<p>
    2 dimensional, bottom-up problems in which the 2 strings are compared to find the longest common sub-sequence. 
</p>
<h2>Palindromes</h2>
<p>
    1 dimensional, bottom-up problems in which the algorithm start at an index and expand on both side to reach the end state.
